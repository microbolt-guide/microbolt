# Security

We make sure that your Microbolt is secured against unauthorized remote access.

The Microbolt will be visible from the internet and therefore needs to be
secured against online attacks using various methods.

## Login with SSH keys

One of the best options to secure the sensitive SSH login is to disable
passwords altogether and require an SSH key certificate. Only someone with
physical possession of the private certificate key can log in.

### Preparations on `host` system

<Steps>
### Create a new public/private key pair

<Callout type="warning">
Skip if you already have one
</Callout>

```sh copy
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Follow instructions, optionally enter a key passphrase to protect your key, you
can use `password [A]`

### The public key now needs to be copied to the PC

```sh copy
cat ./.ssh/id_rsa.pub |
    ssh satoshi@nakamoto01 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

```
</Steps>

### Preparations on `server` system

<Callout type="info">
It's also recommended to change default `ssh` port `22`, to something else like
`2222`
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Disable password and root logins
<Tabs items={['dropbear', 'openssh']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
```sh copy
sed 's/DROPBEAR_OPTS=""/DROPBEAR_OPTS="-w -s -p 2222"/' /etc/conf.d/dropbear > _
$SU mv -f _ /etc/conf.d/dropbear

```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
```sh copy
printf "%s\n" \
    "Port 2222" \
    "PermitRootLogin no" \
    "PasswordAuthentication no" \
    | $SU tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/defaults.conf

```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
### Restart service to apply changes
```sh copy
if $SU rc-service dropbear status | grep -q "started"; then
    $SU rc-service dropbear restart
elif $SU rc-service sshd status | grep -q "started"; then
    $SU rc-service sshd restart
fi
```
</Steps>

## Disable `root` account

```sh copy
$SU passwd -l root
```

## Enabling the Uncomplicated Firewall

A firewall controls what kind of outside traffic your machine accepts and which
applications can send data out. By default, many network ports are open and
listening for incoming connections. Closing unnecessary ports can mitigate many
potential system vulnerabilities.

<Steps>
### Install `ufw`

```sh copy
$SU apk add ip6tables ufw
```

For now, only SSH should be reachable from the outside. Bitcoin Core and LND are
using Tor and don't need incoming ports.

### With user `satoshi`, configure and enable the firewall rules

<Callout type="info">
Replace `22` with your choosen port
</Callout>

```sh copy
$SU ufw default deny incoming
$SU ufw default allow outgoing
$SU ufw allow 22/tcp comment 'allow SSH'
```

```sh copy
$SU ufw logging off
$SU ufw enable
```

### Make sure that the UFW is started automatically on boot
```sh copy
$SU rc-update add ufw default
```

### Check if the UFW is properly configured and active

```sh copy
$SU ufw status verbose
```

```output filename="output"
Status: active
Logging: off
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere                   # allow SSH
22/tcp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)              # allow SSH
```
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
If you find yourself locked out by mistake, you can connect a keyboard and
screen to your PC to log in locally and fix these settings (especially for the
SSH port). 
</Callout>

## fail2ban

The SSH login to the node must be specially protected.
An additional measure is to install `fail2ban`, which prevents an attacker from
gaining access via brute force.
It simply cuts off any remote system with five failed login attempts for ten
minutes.

* Install `fail2ban`

```sh copy
$SU apk add fail2ban
```

* Start and enable on boot

```sh copy
$SU rc-service fail2ban start
$SU rc-update add fail2ban default
```

The initial configuration is fine, as it protects SSH by default.

## Nginx

Several components of this guide will expose a communication port, for example,
the Block Explorer, or the ThunderHub web interface for your Lightning node.
Even if you use these services only within your own home network, communication
should always be encrypted. Otherwise, any device in the same network can listen
to the exchanged data, including passwords.

We use Ngnix to encrypt the communication with SSL/TLS (Transport Layer
Security). This setup is called a "reverse proxy": Nginx provides secure
communication to the outside and routes the traffic back to the internal service
without encryption.

<Steps>
### Install `ngnix`

```sh copy
$SU apk add nginx nginx-mod-stream
```

### Create a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate (valid for 10 years)

```sh copy
$SU openssl req \
    -x509 \
    -nodes \
    -newkey rsa:4096 \
    -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key \
    -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt \
    -subj "/CN=localhost" \
    -days 3650
```

### Backup and create new configuration

NGINX is also a full web server. To use it only as a reverse proxy, backup the
default configuration and paste the following configuration into the
`nginx.conf` file

```sh copy
$SU mv /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.orig
$SU $EDITOR /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

```

```nginx copy filename="/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;

load_module /usr/lib/nginx/modules/ngx_stream_module.so;

error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid /run/nginx/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
  worker_connections 768;
}

http {
  ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
  ssl_session_cache shared:HTTP-TLS:1m;
  ssl_session_timeout 4h;
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
  include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*.conf;
}

stream {
  ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
  ssl_session_cache shared:STREAM-TLS:1m;
  ssl_session_timeout 4h;
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
  include /etc/nginx/streams-enabled/*.conf;
}
```

### Create directories for future configuration files

```sh copy
$SU mkdir -p \
    /etc/nginx/sites-available \
    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled \
    /etc/nginx/streams-available \
    /etc/nginx/streams-enabled
```

### Test this barebone Nginx configuration

```sh copy
$SU nginx -t
```

```output filename="output"
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

### Start Nginx to apply the configuration

```sh copy
$SU rc-service nginx start
```

### Add nginx service to runlevel

```sh copy
$SU rc-update add nginx default
```
</Steps>

You can monitor the Nginx logs by entering this command. Exit with `Ctrl + C`

```sh copy
tail -f /var/log/messages | grep nginx
```

You can monitor Nginx error logs by entering this command. Exit with `Ctrl + C`

```sh copy
$SU tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```
